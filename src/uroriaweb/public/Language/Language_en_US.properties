cosmetic.description=Cosmetic items in the Minecraft Java version were previously only possible through client modifications or were displayed as particles by servers. Neither is the optimal solution, but we have found an optimal way. With the help of our ressource pack, which allows us to add everything from new items over models to new armor, cosmetic items are a key component. So every player of this server can additionally embellish its own game character!
